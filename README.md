## Software Update
### Step 1 - Preparing Memory Card
Prepare a microSD (32GB or below capacity is preferred).
Make sure it is in FAT32 format.

### Step 2 - Getting the Update File
Get the update file ready.
Rename the file to `update.yst` and place it under the root of the microSD.
Eject it from the card reader afterwards.

### Step 3 - Flashing the Update [(YouTube Tutorial)](https://youtu.be/WVAIoss6fbk)
Insert the microSD into the control unit.
The red LED will be flashing rapidly.
Wait until the LED becomes solid and eject the microSD.

### Complete! Test the System
The LED should be flashing constantly now and you are all set!
